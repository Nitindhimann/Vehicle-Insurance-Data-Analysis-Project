# 🚗 Vehicle Insurance Data Analysis Project (2025)

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **Vehicle Insurance dataset** to identify the key factors influencing **insurance claim responses**.  
The analysis was carried out using **Python**, with a strong emphasis on **data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project was to:
- Explore customer and vehicle characteristics that impact insurance claim behavior.
- Understand relationships between **Age, Vehicle Age, Gender, Annual Premium**, and **Claim Response**.
- Provide meaningful insights that could help insurance companies with **risk assessment** and **customer profiling**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Total Records:** 381,109  
- **Total Features:** 12  
- **Key Columns:**  
  `Gender`, `Age`, `Driving_License`, `Region_Code`, `Previously_Insured`,  
  `Vehicle_Age`, `Vehicle_Damage`, `Annual_Premium`, `Policy_Sales_Channel`, `Vintage`, `Response`.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Steps performed:
1. **Checked for missing values** and imputed them using mean (for numerical) and mode (for categorical) values.  
2. **Removed duplicates** and handled outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method.  
3. Converted categorical variables into proper formats for analysis.  

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed detailed **EDA** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize key insights:
- **Histograms** for age and premium distribution.  
- **Boxplots & Violin plots** to compare distributions based on claim response.  
- **Bar charts & Count plots** for gender, vehicle age, and damage impact.  
- **Correlation heatmap** to detect relationships among numerical variables.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Younger customers** and **older vehicles** were more likely to file insurance claims.  
- **Previously insured customers** showed lower claim probabilities.  
- **Annual premium** showed moderate correlation with **claim response**.  
- **Gender distribution** was balanced, but male customers were slightly more represented.  

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data Cleaning & Transformation  
  - Outlier Detection (IQR Method)  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Correlation & Visualization  

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This project provided a clear understanding of how customer demographics and vehicle attributes influence **insurance claim behavior**.  
It also enhanced my practical knowledge of:
- Handling large datasets efficiently  
- Applying statistical and visual analysis  
- Generating actionable business insights from raw data  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in **data analysis, visualization, and feature correlation** — skills that are essential in **data-driven decision-making** for industries like **insurance, banking, and risk management**.
